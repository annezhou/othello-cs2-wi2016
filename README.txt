Anne: Built the player that chooses random moves, implemented the minimax tree

Sophia: Debugged the random-move player, implemented the weighted board and heuristics

Improvements:
- We altered the values of the spaces near the corners and along the edges in the weighted board to more strictly penalize near-corner spaces and make the edge spaces slightly more favorable. This should help the AI make more favorable moves to increase our overall score.
